This application uses the following technologies:
1. JAVA SpringBoot Framework
2. Keycloak as IAM management system
3. HashiCorp Vault as secure credential storage system
4. NginX as secure connection filtering and load balancer
5. OpenSSL as self certificate issuer
6. Docker

The following Deployment diagram shows how the application is deployed with docker

After the docker-compose has been completed, it is possible to execute the command `docker-compose up` to create the containers as follows:
1. All containers start except `maas4you` and `maas4you_proxy` because the application depends on the secret contained in Vault and the proxy depends on the application itself.
2. Visit the address https://localhost:9443/vault to unseal the vault with the three keys fragment and the token.
3. The `maas4you` and `maas4you_proxy` containers can be started correctly.
4. If itâ€™s the FIRST START, visit https://localhost:8443/auth to configure the application's Keycloak realm.
5. Visit https://localhost:8443/maas4you to access the application.
6. To visit the MailHog page and interact with its UI, visit http://localhost:8025/
